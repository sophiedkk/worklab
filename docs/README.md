The current page contains information on wheelchair propulsion research in the worklab and the correspondingly named 
Python package. As such, the page contains a general outline of wheelchair propulsion research, but also some practical 
examples on how to work with that data together with the API-reference of the package. The worklab package aims
to provide functions for the most common data (pre-)processing steps in wheelchair research (at our lab). As such, it is
mainly focussed on the hardware that is available in the worklab at the University Medical Center Groningen. It makes 
extensive use of pandas [dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org/) as those are familiar to most researchers and uses a 
(mostly) functional approach.

üëç Minimal examples
^^^
This part provides you with a set of small examples that you can use to kickstart your analysis. The 
examples are used to showcase the functionality of the package while also showing you some good-practices.

üôå Package documentation
^^^
The API documentation provides a nicely rendered version of all the docstrings in the worklab package. This allows you
to search for functions in the documentation and read them in a way that is easy on the eyes.
